## Matrix chain multiplication

Given a chain of matrices `A1, A2, A3,.....An`, you have to figure out the most efficient way to multiply these matrices. In other words, determine where to place parentheses to minimize the number of multiplications.

Given an array `nums` of size `n`. Dimension of matrix `Ai` ( 0 < i < n ) is nums[i - 1] x nums[i].Find a minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply the chain.
